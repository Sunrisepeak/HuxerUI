# HuxerUI App Development

Use the installed HuxerUI SDK to create, modify, review, or troubleshoot applications and app-side reusable components. Do not use this skill to change HuxerUI framework internals, renderers, platform adapters, SDK packaging, or the framework's own build.

## Recognize the project

Treat the task as HuxerUI SDK application work when the user names HuxerUI or its CLI, or when the project contains one of these signals:

- `find_package(HuxerUI CONFIG REQUIRED)`
- `HuxerUI::huxerui` or `HuxerUI::huxerui_static`
- an include under `<huxerui/...>`
- `import huxerui;` in a source or module interface unit
- an `mcpp.toml` that depends on `huxerui.huxerui`, beside a `build.mcpp` that
  imports `huxerui.rules`

The last two identify an **mcpp** project, which `huxerui create app <name>
--build mcpp` produces. It is HuxerUI application work like any other, and the
public contracts below apply unchanged -- an mcpp project reaches the same
entities through `import huxerui;` that a CMake project reaches through the
umbrella header. What differs is the build: mcpp drives it, not CMake.
`huxerui build`, `huxerui run` and `huxerui package` run the matching `mcpp`
commands, and everything beyond them is `mcpp` itself; there is no
`CMakeLists.txt` and no `platform/` shell to edit, and the SDK discovery below
does not apply -- the framework arrives through the dependency edge. See
`references/cpp-modules-and-mcpp.md`, and `references/mcpp-build.md` for an
independent mcpp project built against a released SDK.

Opening a matching project does not authorize changes or commands by itself.

## Establish the SDK truth

Before relying on an API, identify the SDK used by the project.
An mcpp project skips this section: it names a package version in `mcpp.toml`,
and mcpp resolves it -- there is no installed SDK prefix to locate.

1. Read `HuxerUI_DIR` from the active build directory's `CMakeCache.txt`, then derive the SDK prefix from `lib/cmake/HuxerUI`.
2. Otherwise use `HUXERUI_HOME` when it identifies an installed SDK.
3. Otherwise locate `huxerui` on `PATH` and run `huxerui doctor`.
4. If none is available, ask for the SDK location before relying on exact API or build behavior.

Prefer that SDK's `include/huxerui` and `lib/cmake/HuxerUI` over this Skill's guidance. Do not scan for a source checkout or read its `src`, tests, examples, or design documents to fill gaps. Follow the installed public contract without compatibility aliases.

## Work from public contracts

- Components are ordinary C++ functions returning `View`.
- `View` is a lightweight copy-on-write declaration value. Pass and return it by value; do not add `std::move` to temporary chains, container children, or return statements as a routine optimization.
- Mark a reusable function `[[huxerui::composable]]` when it directly calls a composition-bound `UseXxx()` API or needs its own recomposition lifetime. Do not annotate the application root.
- Keep controlled values authoritative in app state and write emitted changes back for the next composition.
- Use stable semantic keys for dynamic stateful siblings that insert, remove, or reorder.
- Preserve complete `TextEditingValue` state for `TextField`.
- Use only public headers, public CMake targets, generated project conventions, and platform-specific public headers.
- Prefer generated `ImageResource` values for static artwork displayed by HuxerUI components. Keep scalable in-UI artwork as SVG under `resources/images`; use `VectorAsset::Create` or `Canvas` only for genuinely programmatic or dynamic drawing. Platform application and system-tray icons follow their separate packaging contracts.
- Compose built-in layouts and their modifiers before deriving `Layout` or `VirtualLayout`. A custom layout is for a genuinely new measurement or placement algorithm, not ordinary alignment, spacing, growth, wrapping, overlay, paging, scrolling, or responsiveness.
- Start application visuals from `FlatTheme`, `FlatDarkTheme`, `MaterialTheme`, or `MaterialDarkTheme`. Customize their tokens or typed styles instead of recreating a built-in theme with a bare `ThemeDefinition`.
- Choose the narrowest extension mechanism after exhausting its built-in equivalent. Prefer an ordinary component, existing event or modifier, Environment/Theme value, presentation service, or root service. Use a custom `Layout`, retained modifier with `NodeExtension`, `PlatformModule`, `PlatformView`, or `ExternalTexture` only when its distinct geometry, mounted lifetime, or platform boundary is actually required.
- Do not invent APIs, legacy names, private includes, or source-checkout paths.

## Apply changes safely

Inspect the project's existing CMake target, entry point, theme, state ownership, component patterns, and platform configuration before editing. Preserve its generated structure and current generator/compiler. Do not add platforms, compatibility layers, or a new architectural abstraction unless requested.

After editing, check the items applicable to the current change:

- layout under bounded, unbounded, narrow, and expanded constraints relevant to the task;
- controlled values, stable keys, focus, keyboard, hover, pressed, disabled, and semantics;
- reduced-motion behavior for animation;
- platform-specific public contracts and unavailable-platform limits;
- HuxerUI DSL formatting from `dsl-style.md`;
- build and run results only for the current host and affected platforms that are actually available.

When an API is uncertain, inspect the active SDK header, CMake package, or CLI help instead of guessing.
