# Getting Started

This guide uses an installed HuxerUI SDK.
Repository contributors should use [Building HuxerUI](../development/building.md).

## Create a project

```bash
huxerui create app hello_huxer --id dev.example.hello --platform windows,macos,linux,web,android,ios
cd hello_huxer
```

The command creates shared sources under `src`, resources under `resources`, the requested platform shells, and the HuxerUI application-development Skill under `.agents/skills`.
Only build platforms supported by the current development host.

Use `--agent` to select a different Agent Skill directory:

```bash
huxerui create app hello_huxer --platform windows --agent claude,zcode
```

`codex`, `antigravity`, `opencode`, `command-code`, `omp`, and `dsh` share `.agents/skills`; `claude` uses `.claude/skills`; and `zcode` uses `.zcode/skills`.
The default is `codex`, `all` writes all three directories, and `none` omits the Skill.

Add another shell later with:

```bash
huxerui platform add web
```

A Library created without `--platform` remains a common C++ Library but includes an all-platform `examples/preview` application, so `huxerui run <platform>` from the Library tree runs that Preview on a compatible host.

## Diagnose the environment

```bash
huxerui doctor
huxerui doctor web,android
```

`doctor` reports the selected SDK, project configuration, compiler, platform tools, and actionable missing prerequisites without changing the machine.

For supported downloadable prerequisites:

```bash
huxerui setup web,android
```

## Build and run

```bash
huxerui build windows
huxerui run windows
huxerui run web
```

Use `--profile release` for a release configuration.
Use `--generator <name>` only when the host has multiple compatible CMake generators and an explicit selection is required.
Use `--source <path>` to compile HuxerUI from one explicit source checkout for that build instead of consuming the installed SDK binaries:

```bash
huxerui run windows --source ../HuxerUI
```

The source override applies only to that CLI process and its build children; it does not replace the configured `HUXERUI_HOME` in the parent shell. It works without an installed SDK. Without `--source`, the CLI requires an installed SDK; setting `HUXERUI_HOME` to a source checkout does not implicitly select source mode.

Direct CMake builds of generated projects use `-DHUXERUI_HOME=<path>`. CMake loads the source checkout or installed package at that location. Use a separate build directory for each framework location; the CLI does this automatically.

In a project created with `--build mcpp`, the same verbs drive mcpp for the named platform: `huxerui build android` is `mcpp build --target x86_64-linux-android`, `huxerui run android` is `mcpp run --target … --format apk`, and `huxerui package windows` is `mcpp pack --target … --format setup`, the Setup.exe a CMake project packages. `huxerui doctor` reports whether mcpp is available and leaves the toolchains to `mcpp self doctor`. See [C++20/23 Modules and mcpp: Six Platforms](cpp-modules-and-mcpp.md).

The CLI passes the selected framework home through its process environment and build arguments without writing it into platform configuration files. Direct Android Studio builds require `HUXERUI_HOME` in the IDE's environment; direct Xcode builds require it in the IDE's environment or explicit build settings, such as `Config/Local.xcconfig`. An already running IDE does not inherit the CLI's temporary environment or remember its last `--source` selection.

Android and iOS accept a device selected from:

```bash
huxerui devices android
huxerui devices ios
huxerui run android --device <id>
huxerui run ios --device <id>
```

Open the generated iOS project with:

```bash
huxerui open ios
```

Android and iOS commands first resolve the CMake library declarations so Gradle and Xcode can attach their platform packages before compiling. This graph-only configure does not require a host C++ compiler or host HuxerUI binaries. Keep library declarations and aliases available under `HUXERUI_LIBRARY_GRAPH_ONLY`; guard native target configuration and platform dependency discovery with `if (NOT HUXERUI_LIBRARY_GRAPH_ONLY)`. The generated library template already separates these operations. After changing library dependencies, run the CLI build command (or `huxerui open ios`) to refresh platform integration before building directly in the IDE.

## Application source

The application root is an ordinary function returning `View`.
The root already owns a composition scope.

```cpp
#include <huxerui/huxerui.h>

using namespace huxerui;

[[huxerui::composable]]
View Counter() {
  auto count = UseState(0);

  return Column {
    Text::Format("Count: {}", count),
    Button("Increment").OnClick([count] {
      count += 1;
    }),
  }.With(
      Padding(24.0F),
      Spacing(12.0F)
  );
}

View App() {
  return MaterialTheme {
    Counter(),
  };
}

const Application application{
    App,
    {
        .window = {
            .title = "Counter",
            .initial_size = {480.0F, 320.0F},
            .minimum_size = Size{320.0F, 240.0F},
        },
    }
};
```

Mark a reusable function `[[huxerui::composable]]` when it directly calls a composition-bound `UseXxx()` function.
Composable code generation is enabled by the generated CMake project.

## Resources

Place application resources in the generated resource tree:

```text
resources/
  images/
    logo.png
    logo@2x.png
    mark.svg
  raw/
    config.json
  strings/
    default.properties
    zh.properties
```

The build generates typed resource identifiers in `app_resources.h` and packages framework and application resources together.
Raster density variants share one logical size; SVG resources are compiled to platform-neutral vector data.
Static SVG resources may use paths and basic shapes, groups, file-local `defs`/`use` references, one-path `clipPath` geometry, solid or linear/radial gradient fills and strokes, transforms, and root `preserveAspectRatio` mapping.
Gradients support local inheritance, object-bounds or user-space coordinates, `gradientTransform`, stop and paint opacity, and pad extension.
The compiler rejects browser-dependent SVG features such as text, scripts, external styles, invalid gradient transforms, masks, filters, animation, and external references instead of approximating them differently on each renderer.

```cpp
#include <app_resources.h>

return Column {
  Image(app::images::logo),
  Text(app::strings::welcome),
};
```

## Project commands

```text
huxerui create app <name> [--id <project-id>] [-p|--platform <platform-list>] [--agent <agent-list>]
huxerui create library <name> [--namespace <cpp-namespace>] [--target <public-cmake-target>] [--id <project-id>] [-p|--platform <platform-list>] [--agent <agent-list>]
huxerui platform add <platform-list>
huxerui doctor [platform-list]
huxerui setup <platform-list> [--yes]
huxerui devices [platform]
huxerui build [platform-list] [--device <id>] [--profile debug|release] [--generator <name>] [--source <path>] [--java-home <path>]
huxerui run <platform> [--device <id>] [--profile debug|release] [--generator <name>] [--source <path>] [--java-home <path>]
huxerui package <platform-list> [--device <id>] [--profile debug|release] [--generator <name>] [--source <path>] [--java-home <path>]
huxerui open ios [--source <path>]
```

Build outputs stay outside the source tree under the project-owned `.huxerui` directory.
Packaged application artifacts are collected under `dist/<platform>`.
Desktop packages are a Windows setup executable, macOS DMG, or Linux AppImage; see [Packaging Applications](packaging.md) for runtime payload and custom Windows installer guidance.
Android builds accept `--java-home <path>` to use that JDK for the current CLI invocation without changing the shell or generated Gradle project.
Desktop builds honor `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL`; set it to a positive job count to limit concurrent compilation, including builds using `--source`. When unset, the selected build tool uses its default concurrency.
The generated `CMakeLists.txt` keeps source discovery, target creation, resources, and library dependencies explicit.
Its sibling `HuxerUIProject.cmake` contains the generated project plan, SDK discovery, and platform-shell connection details.

On Android, the application library defaults to `lib<cmake-target>.so` and links the shared `libhuxerui.so` framework.
The generated Gradle shell resolves the final CMake artifact name into `BuildConfig.HUXERUI_APP_LIBRARY`, which MainActivity passes to `System.loadLibrary`; changing `OUTPUT_NAME` or a configuration postfix does not require a second library-name setting in Gradle.
All packaged ABIs must use the same application library name, and that name must not be `huxerui`.
Custom Android hosts must load their application library before creating a HuxerUI Runtime; HuxerUIActivity does not load application code on their behalf.
Existing source-controlled shells are not rewritten by SDK updates: migrate their Gradle integration and MainActivity loading code together when adopting this contract.

Library names remain repository and display identities.
`--namespace` selects the exact generated C++ namespace, while `--target` selects an unqualified or single-package-qualified public CMake target.
Package prefixes such as `HuxerUI::` are allowed; the generated targets must not collide with existing CMake targets.
For example, `--namespace scave::camera --target Scave::Camera` generates `<scave/camera.h>`, `scave::camera::Install`, and the consumer target `Scave::Camera`.
When omitted, both values retain the name-derived defaults.
