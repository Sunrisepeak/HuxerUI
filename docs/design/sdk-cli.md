# SDK, CLI, Platform Shell, and Library Design

This document defines the HuxerUI SDK and CLI ownership model, the project workflow, and the extension boundary for PlatformModule integrations and supported platforms.

## Decisions

- Applications and libraries do not use a HuxerUI-specific manifest.
- CMake owns common C++ sources, resources, targets, and the library dependency graph.
- Source-controlled `platform/<platform-id>` shells own platform lifecycle, distribution metadata, signing policy, and platform-only configuration.
- Every platform builds the application through the repository root `CMakeLists.txt`; platform-specific wrapper CMake projects are not part of the target architecture.
- `.huxerui` contains only reproducible generated metadata and platform incremental build output.
- The CLI orchestrates CMake and platform tools; it does not replace Gradle, Xcode, Emscripten, or another platform build system.
- Platform drivers are private CLI implementation, not a public plugin ABI.
- A formal release provides one versioned HuxerUI SDK whose layout keeps host-executed tools distinct from target libraries without exposing separate SDK products.
- SDK installers install and select only the HuxerUI SDK; they do not acquire external platform toolchains.
- `huxerui setup` may acquire missing external platform prerequisites, while `huxerui doctor` remains the shared read-only source of environment diagnostics.
- Source checkout use is an override of the same SDK contract, not a separate integration model.
- HuxerUI built-in resources, library resources, and application resources produce one ordered final `resources.bin` per application.
- Generated library topology contains only ordered library targets and resolved source roots; it never mirrors platform configuration.
- Runtime ownership remains one shared `Runtime` and one `PlatformAdapter` per application surface.

These decisions keep direct CMake use viable and prevent a second project model from drifting away from platform tools.

## Ownership

```

The CLI does not introduce another Runtime, platform-specific application definition, or platform host hierarchy.

## Application project

A generated project has this shape:

```text
hello_huxer/
  .gitignore
  CMakeLists.txt
  HuxerUIProject.cmake
  src/app.cpp
  resources/
    images/
    strings/default.properties
    raw/
  platform/
    android/
      .gitignore
      settings.gradle
      build.gradle
      app/
    ios/
      .gitignore
      App/
        main.mm
        Info.plist
        LaunchScreen.storyboard
        Assets.xcassets/
      Config/
        Base.xcconfig
        Debug.xcconfig
        Release.xcconfig
        Local.xcconfig.example
      hello_huxer.xcodeproj/
    windows/
      main.cpp
      app.manifest
    macos/
      main.cpp
      Info.plist.in
    linux/
      main.cpp
    web/
      index.html.in
  .huxerui/
```

The common files and platform shells are application source and belong in version control.
The CLI never overwrites an existing shell during `platform add` or an ordinary build.

The root `.gitignore` owns only repository-wide generated state:

```gitignore
/.huxerui/
/dist/
/build/
/cmake-build-*/
/.cache/
```

Each platform shell owns its platform-specific ignore rules.
Android ignores Gradle and CMake intermediates inside `platform/android`, while Apple and future platforms keep their own IDE and package-manager state local to their shell.
The application declaration remains shared:

```cpp
#include <huxerui/huxerui.h>

using namespace huxerui;

View App() {
  return MaterialTheme {
    Text("Hello, HuxerUI"),
  };
}

const Application application{App};
```

Platform shells own the process entry point and call `RunApplication()` after static initialization.
Hosted platforms such as Android and Web create sessions from the same automatically registered `Application`.

## CMake SDK

Installed applications use the standard package entry point:

```cmake
find_package(HuxerUI CONFIG REQUIRED)

file(GLOB_RECURSE APP_SOURCE_FILES CONFIGURE_DEPENDS
        "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cpp"
        "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cc"
        "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/*.cxx"
)

huxerui_add_app(hello_huxer
        SOURCES
            ${APP_SOURCE_FILES}
        RESOURCES
            resources
        RESOURCE_NAMESPACE
            app
)
```

The SDK owns the public `HuxerUIConfig.cmake`, application, library, code-generation, and resource helpers, host tools, built-in resource location, public headers, and the target-platform libraries present in that SDK form.
Source-build target and platform configuration remains private to the repository and is not installed into the consumer package.
`HuxerUIConfig.cmake` is the only public CMake package and exposes only canonical HuxerUI framework targets.
Desktop packages import both targets by default, and `huxerui_add_app` selects the static target.
Android imports only the shared `HuxerUI::huxerui` target because its Java host loads `libhuxerui.so`; Web and iOS use static framework artifacts.
Consumers may request only `COMPONENTS shared` or `COMPONENTS static`; requesting the Linux shared component does not resolve static-only dependencies, while the static component resolves the distribution-owned GTK 4, GIO, and libsoup 3 libraries through pkg-config.
Platform package managers may carry platform libraries and integration code, but they do not introduce a second public HuxerUI package or a forwarding target hierarchy.
The CLI or source-controlled platform shell supplies the resolved SDK location to CMake; application source does not encode an SDK archive layout.
An in-tree source override creates the same canonical targets and loads the same helpers without changing the application declarations below the SDK bootstrap.
Only a top-level desktop HuxerUI build registers SDK installation and CPack behavior; consuming the source tree through `add_subdirectory` creates framework targets and public helpers without adding packaging or install rules to the parent project.

`huxerui_add_app`:

- Creates an executable, application bundle, or Android application library for the active platform.
- Links a canonical HuxerUI target.
- Enables composable code generation after all declared sources are known.
- Registers the optional resource root.
- Accepts an optional `RESOURCE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` for a platform shell that owns final package staging.
- Applies bundle metadata supplied by the application.
- Emits minimal application artifact metadata consumed by CLI launch commands.

Advanced consumers may still create targets directly and call `huxerui_enable_codegen` and `huxerui_add_resources`, but manually created targets do not implicitly register the framework resource package.
Application executables use `huxerui_add_app` so built-in resources are always the first merge input.
`huxerui_add_resources` may be called repeatedly for one target.
CMake retains call order, and the final resource build lets later matching variants override earlier variants while keeping nonmatching variants.
For application targets, the precompiled framework package and all registered roots are merged through outputs attached directly to the target, without auxiliary resource targets.
Each call supplies a root and a `NAMESPACE` value that is both the resource domain and exact generated C++ namespace; only its generated header adds `_resources`.
`huxerui_add_app` registers the framework package first and then the compact `RESOURCES resources` application root.
An application that needs to replace selected framework defaults adds a later root with `NAMESPACE huxerui`; no bundle metadata is required.

The current install already contains public headers, platform libraries, the precompiled framework resource package, CMake helpers, the CLI, host code generators, and the canonical HuxerUI application-development Skill.
Formal releases preserve that single-SDK contract while platform package managers carry the artifacts they own.
Host tools are selected from `share/huxerui/tools/<host>/<architecture>` and always run on the development host, independently of the target architecture.
Android host packages use the Android ABI spelling `arm64-v8a` and contain native Bionic executables; they never reuse Linux aarch64 tools.

## Generated integration

Generated files are projections, not another source of truth.
Desktop and Web builds use application artifact metadata emitted by the shared application helper.
Android reads Gradle's APK `output-metadata.json`, while iOS uses build-result metadata emitted by its Xcode build phase, so launch uses the final variant application ID and artifact name.
Launch metadata remains build output rather than a duplicate project identity and is distinct from dependency discovery.

When a platform package manager must attach source-backed library packages, CMake emits `.huxerui/generated/libraries.json` from the resolved common library graph.
Each source-backed entry contains only:

- The requested CMake target identity.
- The resolved library source root.

Entry order is `huxerui_use_library` declaration order.
Predeclared binary targets without a source root do not appear; their platform artifacts are declared through the owning platform package manager.
Android settings use the graph to include `platform/android` library projects, and the Apple library aggregator may use the same graph to resolve `platform/ios` Swift packages.
Windows and Linux require no platform projection when their library integration remains entirely inside CMake.

The library graph never contains an application identifier, SDK or NDK versions, ABIs, product names, permissions, platform dependencies, hooks, resource namespaces, or SDK selection.
Those values remain in their owning Gradle, Xcode, platform package, or CMake files.
Only the CLI's graph-only configure writes the platform library graph, once at the end of the application directory; normal native configurations never overwrite it.
The CLI supplies the graph output path, and unchanged graph content preserves its timestamp.
Deleting `.huxerui/generated` and running `huxerui build android`, `huxerui build ios`, or `huxerui open ios` reproduces the graph and required platform-package integration.
The CLI never parses `CMakeLists.txt` or `HuxerUIProject.cmake` as source text.

## CLI surface

The implemented command surface is:

```text
huxerui create app <name> [--id <reverse-domain-id>] [-p|--platform <platform-list>] [--agent <agent-list>]
huxerui create library <name> [--namespace <cpp-namespace>] [--target <public-cmake-target>] [--id <reverse-domain-id>] [-p|--platform <platform-list>] [--agent <agent-list>]
huxerui platform add <platform-list>
huxerui doctor [platform-list]
huxerui setup <platform-list> [--yes]
huxerui devices [platform]
huxerui build [platform-list] [--device <id>] [--profile debug|release] [--generator <name>] [--source <path>] [--java-home <path>]
huxerui mcpp build [--source <path>] [--release] [--locked] [--offline] [--verbose]
huxerui run <platform> [--device <id>] [--profile debug|release] [--generator <name>] [--source <path>] [--java-home <path>]
huxerui package <platform-list> [--device <id>] [--profile debug|release] [--generator <name>] [--source <path>] [--java-home <path>]
huxerui open ios [--source <path>]
```

A platform list is comma-separated or `all`.
`all` means every platform driver known to the current CLI for `create` and every enabled application platform for project commands.
An agent list is comma-separated and selects where the SDK's application-development Skill is copied into a new project.
The accepted identifiers are `codex`, `claude`, `antigravity`, `opencode`, `command-code`, `omp`, `dsh`, and `zcode`.
`codex`, `antigravity`, `opencode`, `command-code`, `omp`, and `dsh` map to `.agents/skills`; `claude` maps to `.claude/skills`; and `zcode` maps to `.zcode/skills`.
The default is `codex`; `all` selects the three distinct directories, and `none` disables Skill creation.
An explicit list replaces the default, and aliases that share a directory are deduplicated.

`huxerui mcpp build` is an independent generic mcpp frontend. It requires `mcpp.toml` in the selected source directory and invokes the `mcpp` executable directly. It does not participate in HuxerUI project discovery, alter the existing CMake and platform-driver paths, or provide HuxerUI package integration; the mcpp project owns those details.
Desktop CMake build commands leave concurrency to CMake and its selected build tool, preserving `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` for callers and CI. They do not force an unnumbered `--parallel`, which becomes unlimited parallelism with Unix Makefiles.

### Create and platform add

```bash
huxerui create app hello_huxer --id dev.example.hello --platform windows,android
cd hello_huxer
huxerui platform add macos
```

Application creation writes the common CMake project and complete minimal shells for the selected platforms.
Library creation writes a common CMake library and a normal application under `examples/preview` that consumes it through a local path.
When no Library platform integration is requested, the Library remains common-only while its Preview receives the same all-platform default as an application.
Each generated `CMakeLists.txt` explicitly scans and passes its source files to `huxerui_add_app` or `huxerui_add_library`, so applications may replace or refine that policy without changing the CLI integration layer.
The sibling `HuxerUIProject.cmake` directly emits the CLI project plan and owns SDK discovery plus generated platform-shell configuration; it never creates a target or discovers application and library sources.
The template creates `resources/images`, `resources/raw`, and `resources/strings` directly, without an additional domain directory.
It uses a temporary tree and publishes the project only after every file succeeds.
`platform add` fills only missing application shells or Library platform packages, never overwrites an existing tree, and rolls back directories created by a failed multi-platform operation.

### Doctor

`doctor` is read-only.
Outside a project it reports the SDK, common tools, available drivers, and any explicitly requested platform tools.
Inside a project it also validates required common files, unknown platform directories, shell contents, current-host support, and required platform tools.

Checks are scoped to requested platforms.
A missing Android toolchain does not make a Windows-only diagnostic fail.
Host environment diagnosis and project-shell diagnosis remain separate operations even when one `doctor` invocation reports both.
Environment diagnosis owns tool discovery, versions, executable paths, licenses, and actionable remediation; project diagnosis owns repository structure and generated or source-controlled shell validity.
The diagnostic result carries one stable requirement identity, status, display label, and optional detail; common and per-driver checks use the same result without introducing an environment-provider hierarchy.
Checks report SDK selection, host availability, executable paths, versions, licenses, and remediation where applicable.
The same environment diagnosis is reused by `setup` before and after any installation, so the two commands cannot disagree about readiness.

### Setup

```text
huxerui setup <platform-list> [--yes]
```

`setup` installs or configures missing external prerequisites for an explicitly requested comma-separated platform list.
It never defaults to every platform; a user who wants that scope must pass `all` explicitly.
The command first runs the same read-only environment diagnosis as `doctor`, prints the intended changes and their owning package managers or official distribution channels, and requests confirmation unless `--yes` is present.
It is idempotent: satisfied requirements remain untouched, and a successful run ends by repeating diagnosis for every requested platform.

Platform prerequisites continue to use their official ownership mechanisms.
For example, Android SDK and NDK components use Android tooling, Web requirements use the Emscripten toolchain's supported installation path, and Windows requirements use supported Microsoft installers or package sources.
Dependencies that require manual interaction, account acceptance, platform licensing, or system UI are opened or reported with an actionable official path instead of being simulated by the CLI.
`setup` reports the environment as incomplete until the corresponding `doctor` checks pass.

`setup` does not install, select, upgrade, or remove HuxerUI itself.
That remains the responsibility of the SDK installer and avoids a recursive dependency in which the installed CLI owns its own installation.

### Update

```text
huxerui update [--check] [--version <version>] [--yes]
```

`update` is a project-independent entry point into the SDK installer, not a second installation engine.
The command uses normal SDK discovery but rejects source checkouts and a selected SDK whose `bin/huxerui` is not the running executable.
The CLI embeds the repository's installation scripts at build time, extracts the applicable script to a private temporary directory, and invokes it with explicit arguments.
It does not download executable scripts from a moving latest-release URL or link against the framework HTTP implementation.

The installer owns release resolution, version comparison, confirmation, downloads, checksum and archive checks, staging, publication, and failure recovery.
Update mode requires an existing SDK and never rewrites persistent environment selection or application files.
Latest-release selection does not downgrade; explicit `major.minor.patch` versions may downgrade, and the same version does not reinstall.
`--check` reports the comparison without downloading an archive or writing the installation.
The current version comes from the selected SDK CLI, not a separate SDK manifest.

Install, update, and uninstall serialize mutation through a per-prefix lock.
An update verifies the replacement CLI's version before and after publication and preserves the old SDK until publication succeeds.
The Unix installer ends the rollback phase before deleting the old backup; backup cleanup failure warns about remaining files without reverting a successfully published SDK.
This provides recovery from handled failures, not atomic recovery from power loss or forced termination.
The user must stop other SDK tools and builds before updating; the installer does not terminate them.

On Windows, the embedded installer launches a temporary PowerShell worker after confirmation and returns a distinct handoff status.
The worker waits for the original CLI to exit, uses the already selected release version, and records its result in a transcript beside the temporary script.
The CLI reports the transcript location and treats a successful handoff separately from a completed update; its zero exit status cannot attest to the worker's eventual installation result.
The temporary worker directory is retained for diagnosis.
Other hosts run the installer synchronously and return its result.

### Devices

Device discovery does not require a project.
On desktop hosts, the Android driver parses `adb devices -l` and preserves ready, offline, unauthorized, and unavailable states.
On an Android host, the current device is an implicit local execution destination rather than a discovered device, so `devices android` and `--device` are unsupported and ADB is not required.
The iOS driver combines paired physical devices from `devicectl` with booted Simulators from `simctl` and retains the selected device kind through build and launch.
Desktop drivers do not expose synthetic devices.

### Build

CLI-managed build directories live below `.huxerui/build/<home-key>/<platform>/<profile>`. iOS uses explicit `ios-simulator` and `ios-device` DerivedData roots so Simulator and device products, intermediates, architectures, and signing state never share one directory.
The CLI validates the complete requested set before executing commands and prints each platform command.
`build`, `run`, `package`, and `open ios` accept `--source <path>` as a strict per-invocation HuxerUI source-checkout override.
The override replaces only the effective HuxerUI home passed through the existing platform command context and child-process environment; it does not persist or rewrite the parent shell's installed SDK selection.
Configure commands pass the effective home through `-DHUXERUI_HOME`. Each framework location uses its own CMake cache, so switching between an installed SDK and a source checkout preserves both incremental builds.

Desktop builds configure the root CMake project and then build it.
Fresh Linux and macOS builds use Ninja when it is available unless an explicit generator, `CMAKE_GENERATOR`, or an existing CMake cache takes precedence.
Windows discovers the latest Visual Studio installation that provides the C++ x64 tools without constraining its product version, imports its developer environment, and explicitly selects MSVC.
Fresh Windows builds use Ninja when available and NMake otherwise; an existing Windows cache retains its compatible generator while the compiler remains MSVC.
`huxerui_add_app` selects the Windows GUI subsystem on the application target only. MSVC applications retain `main()` through `mainCRTStartup`; the installer helper selects `wWinMainCRTStartup` through the private `HUXERUI_WINDOWS_CRT_ENTRY` target property for its existing `wWinMain()` entry. Both paths preserve CRT initialization. The mcpp build states the same selection declaratively, as `[targets.<name>] windows_subsystem = "windows"`. The framework's public link interface carries no subsystem or entry-point option, and Runtime does not allocate or hide a console.
The Windows SDK packages matching Debug and Release shared and static libraries so the CLI's default Debug profile and explicit Release profile use the corresponding MSVC runtime.
`--generator` applies to Linux, macOS, and Web builds. Windows, Android, and iOS reject it because their platform drivers own the supported generator and toolchain selection.

iOS builds invoke the source-controlled Xcode project. A build without `--device` uses the generic Simulator destination; selecting a Simulator or physical device uses its Xcode destination identifier, and a physical-device build allows automatic provisioning updates. The App target invokes CMake through source-controlled scripts to produce a destination-specific application core, links it into the bundle, and stages its resources.

Android builds invoke the source-controlled Gradle shell, whose `externalNativeBuild` configures the repository root `CMakeLists.txt` directly.
Gradle owns the application namespace, application identifier, compile and target SDK versions, minimum SDK, NDK version, ABI filters, dependencies, manifest merging, signing, and APK output.
The application attaches each consumed library's `platform/android` Gradle library in library-graph order.
Before Gradle starts, the CLI incrementally configures the same root project with `HUXERUI_LIBRARY_GRAPH_ONLY=ON` to refresh only the platform-neutral library graph needed during Gradle settings evaluation. This mode records the declared application and library relationships without enabling C++, configuring a host platform backend, creating a native application target, compiling sources, or scheduling resources. Its dedicated build directory is independent of Gradle, Xcode, and platform build directories.
Both source and installed SDK entry points use the same declaration-only framework targets in this mode; installed headers, resources, host libraries, and platform dependencies are not loaded for graph discovery.
Application and library helpers create non-compiling interface targets for dependency discovery. Library aliases and `huxerui_use_library` declarations remain available in both modes, while compiler settings, platform dependency discovery, resource build operations, and other native target configuration stay outside graph-only execution. Generated library templates return after declaring the library and its alias; custom library CMake files must preserve that boundary when adding native configuration.
The iOS Swift package projection is written only when its content changes.
The ABI-specific C++ build remains exclusively owned by Gradle's root-project `externalNativeBuild` invocation.
The Android application shared library defaults to its CMake target name; `OUTPUT_NAME` and configuration postfixes remain target-owned.
The shell supplies `HUXERUI_ANDROID_APP_INTEGRATION_ROOT` with a variant-specific build directory, and each real NDK configure generates the existing application integration plan at `<root>/<abi>/app.json` with its final artifact path.
AGP's public `MERGED_NATIVE_LIBS` artifact supplies the native build dependency and the ABI directories participating in this build, including Android Studio device-only builds; unused ABI plans from earlier builds do not participate in resolution.
A Gradle resolver reads the corresponding application plans, validates the common target and loadable `lib<name>.so` filename and its presence in each ABI directory, and supplies the name through a task-backed Provider to `BuildConfig.HUXERUI_APP_LIBRARY`.
The application library name must be distinct from the framework library, and missing plans or artifacts fail the build instead of falling back to a guessed name.
The application MainActivity loads that constant before creating the hosted Runtime; HuxerUIActivity does not load application code, while HuxerUIView continues to load the shared framework `huxerui`.
The graph-only library plan does not describe native artifacts, and no Gradle property, source parser, private AGP cache inspection, or directory scan duplicates CMake's library naming decision.
Each ABI writes its merged HuxerUI package to an explicit variant-owned resource directory. Gradle selects a package from the participating ABI directories and performs one sync into generated assets without inspecting private `.cxx` directories or comparing timestamps.
The staging task owns an output DirectoryProperty registered through `variant.sources.assets.addGeneratedSourceDirectory`, so resource merging and lint both inherit its native build and staging dependencies; source sets do not independently list the generated directory.
The generated shell includes the source-controlled Gradle 8.13 wrapper, pins the official binary distribution by URL and SHA-256 checksum, and invokes only its local `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat`.
Gradle itself therefore does not need to be installed separately; the Java runtime remains a host prerequisite.
`--java-home <path>` validates a JDK root and temporarily exports it as `JAVA_HOME` for the Android Gradle invocation without changing the caller's shell, project metadata, or generated Gradle files.
The explicit option takes precedence over an inherited `JAVA_HOME`; without it, the Gradle wrapper retains its standard environment and `PATH` lookup behavior.
On an Android host, the same Gradle shell is restricted to `arm64-v8a` and receives the Termux `aapt2` executable through AGP's tool override.
The Android host path does not introduce another generated project or native build owner; it requires an existing Android SDK platform and an NDK layout that can execute on Termux.

Web builds use `emcmake` to configure the same root CMake project and produce the ES module, WebAssembly module, and project-owned HTML entry point.
The Web shell owns the HTML document and host-element mount code rather than hiding them in the SDK.

### Run

`run` accepts exactly one enabled platform and performs a build before launch.
Windows starts the executable, macOS opens the application bundle, desktop Web hosts delegate the generated HTML entry point to `emrun`, Android installs and launches the generated APK, and iOS uses `simctl` for a selected booted Simulator and `devicectl` for a paired physical device.
On Windows hosts, the Web driver asks `emrun` to open its URL through `explorer.exe` so the operating system selects the default browser without relying on Python browser discovery.
On Android hosts, the Web driver binds a Python standard-library server to an available loopback port, opens the generated entry URL through `termux-open`, and keeps the server in the foreground until interruption.
This path never selects Emscripten's ADB-backed Android mode or exposes the server to another network interface.

For Android on desktop hosts, one ready device is selected automatically.
Multiple ready devices require `--device <id>`, and an explicit device must exist and be ready before building.
For Android on Termux, `run` opens the generated APK through `termux-open` and delegates user confirmation and application launch to the system package installer.

### Package

`package <platform-list>` builds Release output unless `--profile` is explicit, then asks each platform driver to produce its platform-native distribution artifact.
Intermediate staging lives below `.huxerui/package/<platform>/<profile>` and is never a user-facing result.
The shared command validates the final artifact and publishes it below `dist/<platform>` only after every preparation and packaging command succeeds, so a failed package never removes the previous valid result.

Desktop platforms intentionally use different containers:

- Windows produces one Burn `setup.exe` containing the application MSI and its HuxerUI bootstrapper application.
- macOS produces one DMG containing the complete application bundle and an Applications link.
- Linux produces one executable AppImage containing the application, its HuxerUI resources, and application-declared runtime payloads.

Application icons remain editable native assets in their generated platform shells.
Windows uses one `app.ico` for the application executable, installer executable, Burn bundle, shortcuts, and installed-product metadata; macOS embeds `AppIcon.icns` in the application bundle; Linux installs its target-named SVG beside the AppImage desktop entry.
Android owns launcher density and adaptive icon resources, iOS owns its AppIcon asset catalog, and Web owns its favicon and touch icon.
The generated defaults share the HuxerUI brand mark, while the build and package layers do not add a cross-platform icon property, perform image conversion, customize the macOS volume icon, or introduce a second Windows installer icon.

Android, iOS, and Web retain their platform-owned store, archive, and deployment outputs rather than pretending that an interactive desktop installer applies to them.
An explicitly requested unsupported platform, missing package tool, malformed staging tree, or missing final artifact fails the command instead of producing a partial success message.

Application installation content comes only from CMake install rules.
The generated application installs its executable and final HuxerUI resource package, then the runtime-dependency module recursively deploys non-system dynamic dependencies during installation.
`huxerui_add_runtime_dependencies` registers additional shared-library targets, modules, or prebuilt files that runtime loading hides from the binary graph, together with optional installation destinations and search hints.
Ordinary data remains in application-owned install rules.
`huxerui_add_app` records the single package component in the application target's `HUXERUI_APPLICATION_INSTALL_COMPONENT` property, so generated shells and application-owned install rules share the same value without a directory-scoped variable.
The CLI never scans an executable dependency graph or copies every adjacent dynamic library.
The staged tree is a projection of those rules, not another package manifest.
`HuxerUIRuntimeDependencies.cmake` owns both declaration and deployment functions; dependency inputs are generated in their declaring directory, while each application directory generates its per-configuration deployment entry.
The top-level directory schedules these entries after ordinary installation rules so parent-directory payloads also participate in deployment and final validation.
Installation entries read the final target-owned input list, including declarations made later by a parent or sibling directory, without promoting imported targets to global visibility.
Dependency discovery uses original binaries, while copying, load-path rewriting, and final validation operate on fresh staging trees.
Collection classifies explicit and discovered dependencies before copying; staged validation enforces the same system-runtime boundary.
Windows uses executable-local dependencies and toolchain Release VC++ redistributables, resolving them through an explicit CMake setting, CMake discovery, the active compiler installation, or its developer environment in that order.
macOS uses bundle Frameworks and PlugIns with relative load commands and signatures applied after fixup; Linux uses AppDir `usr/lib` and per-binary relative RUNPATHs while retaining the distribution-owned desktop stack.
Missing required dependencies, conflicting destinations, invalid architectures, unsupported Debug CRTs, and external non-system dependencies remaining after deployment are fatal.

### Windows installer

Windows uses WiX v5 Burn and MSI as the installation engine.
Burn owns detection, planning, caching, elevation, apply, cancellation, rollback, repair, uninstall, and restart semantics.
HuxerUI owns only the bootstrapper application's interface and presentation.
The bootstrapper application is a normal out-of-process HuxerUI executable using the existing Windows `PlatformAdapter` and shared `Runtime`; it is not a Runtime subclass, embedded MSI UI, NSIS child window, PlatformView, or PlatformModule.

The generated Windows shell contains editable installer source and resources under `platform/windows/package`.
Its interface text uses the installer target's ordinary HuxerUI string resources and the Runtime's one locale configuration; the required default catalog supplies fallback text, and language or region catalogs use the same resolution chain as application resources.
The native folder picker and messages returned by Burn remain platform-owned text rather than a second installer localization registry.
Normal `build` and `run` commands neither build that target nor require WiX.
Windows package mode restores the pinned WiX tool and native bootstrapper API into package-local generated storage, verifies their hashes, builds the installer UI against `HuxerUI::huxerui_static`, and independently stages the application and installer through CMake install rules before producing one bundle.
The installer component includes its executable, resources, `mbanative.dll`, and its own complete non-system dependency closure, including Release VC++ runtime DLLs.
WiX payload generation consumes that complete staged directory and excludes only the bootstrapper executable already declared by the bundle source.
The Windows installer CMake module owns the WiX version, package layout, restoration, and tool validation as one dependency contract.
The restored framework-dependent tool requires `Microsoft.NETCore.App` 6.0 or newer, but does not require a system-wide WiX installation.
The initial Windows package implementation targets x64 and rejects another architecture explicitly.
No package dependency becomes part of the installed application or the ordinary framework targets.

The platform-specific `<huxerui/windows/installer.h>` surface provides one composition-bound `InstallerHandle` backed by one root-owned installer session.
Its coalesced status contains the current phase, detected product state, expanded authored destination and desktop-shortcut default, active action, overall progress, current package, optional prompt, optional failure, and restart requirement.
Commands choose an installation directory asynchronously through the window-owned system picker, start install with one optional override object, repair or uninstall, request cooperative cancellation, and answer the currently identified prompt.
It does not expose WiX interfaces, HRESULT callbacks, a second event stream, duplicated `can_xxx` flags, or a generic cross-platform installer abstraction.
Installing over an older product is the ordinary install action rather than a separate update command.

Burn's `InstallFolder` and `CreateDesktopShortcut` variables are the only authored defaults and the only values passed into the matching MSI properties.
The generated HuxerUI interface keeps only controlled local drafts, initializes them from the expanded Burn values, and submits one `InstallerInstallOptions` value when installation begins.
The MSI always installs the Start menu entry and models the optional desktop shortcut as its own Feature so Windows Installer can retain the selected Feature state across major upgrades.
Taskbar pinning remains an application-owned foreground request because Windows requires explicit user interaction and confirmation and excludes installers from that workflow.
The folder picker is Windows-installer behavior rather than an expansion of the cross-platform file-capability API.
Its Task is launched from the interface's composition-owned `TaskScope`, whose queued first resume lets the requesting pointer event finish before the native modal dialog starts.

Burn callbacks publish immutable status changes through the Windows UI dispatcher before notifying composition dependencies.
User commands enter Burn from the bootstrapper UI thread, while callback-driven continuation follows Burn's callback thread model.
Synchronous engine questions expose one identified prompt at a time; answering a stale prompt has no effect.
Closing during an active apply requests cancellation and allows Burn to finish rollback before the bootstrapper exits.
The installer operation is root-owned and never belongs to a component `TaskScope`, because unmounting one component must not cancel a process-wide installation transaction.

This interface is Windows-only.
macOS package mode produces a DMG for an ordinary application; release signing and notarization remain owned by the application's release pipeline.
Products that require multiple privileged destinations or installation scripts may use the system Installer with a PKG outside this ordinary application flow.
Linux AppImage, deb, rpm, and Flatpak installation remains owned by their native execution or package-manager model.
Android, iOS, and Web retain system, store, and browser distribution behavior.
HuxerUI therefore unifies the `package` command and artifact ownership without inventing a cross-platform installer UI contract.

## SDK selection and distribution

An official HuxerUI version may publish several host installers and platform artifacts, but they are release forms of one SDK rather than independently selected SDK layers.
The project version, CMake package version, platform package version, CLI version, and resource binary compatibility are produced from the same release.

### SDK home and discovery

`HUXERUI_HOME` is the public environment variable for selecting an installed SDK or an explicit source checkout.
For an installed SDK it names the self-contained installation prefix:

```text
HUXERUI_HOME/
  bin/
    huxerui[.exe]
    huxerui.dll                         # Windows Release framework runtime
    huxerui_debug.dll                   # Windows Debug framework runtime
  include/
  lib/
    huxerui.lib                         # Windows Release DLL import library
    huxerui_debug.lib                   # Windows Debug DLL import library
    huxerui_static.lib                  # Windows Release static library
    huxerui_static_debug.lib            # Windows Debug static library
    cmake/HuxerUI/
  share/huxerui/
    skills/huxerui-app-development/
    platform/
      android/
        HuxerUI.aar
        <abi>/libhuxerui.so
      ios/HuxerUI.xcframework/             # macOS SDK only
        ios-arm64/
        ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/
      web/emscripten-4.0.19/libhuxerui.a
    resources/
    tools/<host>/<architecture>/
```

`HUXERUI_HOME/bin` belongs on `PATH` for a portable or installer-managed SDK.
The Windows `bin` directory contains both executable tools and loadable runtime binaries; it is not a CLI-only directory.
Windows places DLL import libraries beside static archives under `lib`, and the `_static` filename distinguishes the archives that contain the complete framework implementation.
Consumers select these files through `HuxerUI::huxerui` or `HuxerUI::huxerui_static` rather than linking an installation filename directly.
The Windows target exports are generated by installing Debug and Release from one multi-configuration build, so standard CMake configuration selection chooses the matching artifacts.
The CLI resolves its home in this order:

- A valid explicit `HUXERUI_HOME`.
- A valid installed SDK derived from the running `huxerui` executable.

SDK discovery locates the configured candidate without rejecting it before command parsing. Build commands validate it as an installed SDK unless an explicit `--source <path>` supplies a source checkout; the override works without an installed SDK and takes precedence over an invalid `HUXERUI_HOME`.
The CLI exports the effective `HUXERUI_HOME` to build children. It never changes the parent shell or persistent system environment, and `doctor` diagnoses the normally selected installed SDK.
A source path in `HUXERUI_HOME` alone does not enable source builds. Every CLI invocation without `--source` requires an installed SDK.
It is not a second installed-SDK selector: `doctor`, `setup`, project creation, and platform-shell generation continue to use the normally resolved SDK, while build children receive the effective home through the process environment and build arguments.
The CLI must remain usable when the environment variable is absent, because a platform installer can place `huxerui` on `PATH` more reliably than every operating system can persist an arbitrary environment variable for all shells and GUI processes.
Generated projects accept `HUXERUI_HOME` as the framework location and load its source or installed layout. Direct consumers of the installed package may still use standard `find_package(HuxerUI CONFIG REQUIRED)` lookup.
The former `HUXERUI_SDK_ROOT` input has been removed rather than retained as an alias.

A source root exposes the same canonical targets, helpers, tools, and resource contract as a local development override.
Project templates use `add_subdirectory` for the selected source checkout and `find_package` for an installed SDK. Both expose the same application, library, resource, and codegen helpers, and both enter declaration-only graph discovery without configuring native framework targets. No separate source package entry point or build-mode setting is required.
CLI-managed CMake directories live under `.huxerui/build/<home-key>/<platform>/<profile>`; the home key derives only from the normalized framework location. Graph discovery uses `<home-key>/library-graph`. Switching framework locations preserves independent caches instead of reusing imported-target or source-build state.
Android reads the effective `HUXERUI_HOME` from the child-process environment. Gradle loads the matching source project or AAR and passes the home to externalNativeBuild, whose argument-specific CMake directories separate native configurations. iOS receives the home as an explicit `xcodebuild` setting, and the CLI's home-specific DerivedData path separates native configurations. The CLI does not write framework selection into `local.properties` or `Local.xcconfig`; existing Android SDK and signing settings remain user-owned. Direct IDE builds use the IDE's environment or explicit build settings and do not retain the CLI's last `--source` selection.
The executable's embedded templates and source-tree development skill lookup remain separate from framework build selection.
No `sdk.json` is required: standard CMake and platform-package metadata describe the installed SDK and platform artifacts, while platform-specific facts remain in the platform integration that owns them.

### Platform release forms

Platform build systems consume platform artifacts through their normal mechanisms:

- Android uses a Java-only AAR plus ABI-specific shared libraries imported by the installed CMake package.
- Android arm64-v8a also has a host SDK for Termux containing Bionic CLI and host-tool executables.
- macOS uses its host libraries and installed `HuxerUIPlatform` Clang module, while the macOS SDK carries a static iOS XCFramework with its UIKit `HuxerUIPlatform` module for device and Simulator application-core builds.
- Windows and Linux use architecture- and toolchain-compatible CMake SDK archives.
- Web uses the Emscripten 4.0.19 static library from the selected SDK while configuring the application root through `emcmake`.

Platform packages do not duplicate common application policy or introduce another runtime resource store.
Android may substitute the repository Gradle library explicitly for source development, while installed and source CMake paths preserve the same canonical HuxerUI targets.
Windows, macOS, Linux, Web, Android, and iOS consume the installed package through the same canonical CMake targets.
An installed iOS build selects the matching device or Simulator slice from the XCFramework carried only by the macOS SDK.
The module maps are language import surfaces over the existing platform libraries, not separately registered services or runtime artifacts.

### Installers

The canonical install rules produce one relocatable SDK tree, and thin platform installers place that tree, expose its `bin` directory, and remove only state they own during uninstall.
The repository provides `install.sh` for published macOS, Linux, and Android archives and `install.ps1` for Windows archives.
These scripts install a selected HuxerUI SDK release, persist `HUXERUI_HOME`, expose `HUXERUI_HOME/bin` on `PATH`, and support repeatable upgrade or uninstall without modifying unrelated profile content.
They may download and verify an official HuxerUI SDK archive, but they never download a compiler, CMake, Java, Android SDK or NDK, Emscripten, Xcode, Visual Studio, signing identity, or another platform prerequisite.
Platform packages may later provide the same SDK-only behavior through operating-system installation mechanisms.

```text
install.sh [--version <version>] [--prefix <path>] [--profile <path>] [--archive <path>] [--yes]
install.sh --uninstall [--prefix <path>] [--profile <path>] [--yes]
install.sh --update --prefix <path> [--version <version>] [--check] [--yes]

install.ps1 [-Version <version>] [-Prefix <path>] [-Archive <path>] [-Yes]
install.ps1 -Uninstall [-Prefix <path>] [-Yes]
install.ps1 -Update -Prefix <path> [-Version <version>] [-Check] [-Yes]
```

Without an explicit version, an installer resolves the latest release from `https://github.com/HuxerUI/HuxerUI`.
An explicit archive enables offline installation and tests but still requires its adjacent CPack-generated `.sha256` file.
macOS defaults to `~/Library/Developer/HuxerUI`, Linux and Android default to `~/.local/share/HuxerUI`, Windows defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HuxerUI`, and an explicit prefix replaces that default without changing the SDK layout.
Publication uses a sibling staging directory and preserves the prior valid SDK until the new SDK and environment selection succeed.
Upgrade and uninstall refuse a non-SDK directory, a filesystem root, or the user's home directory.
A pushed `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` tag must match the CMake project version before release builds begin.
Release assembly publishes one archive per supported host package and includes only the platform artifacts owned by that package.
The iOS XCFramework is an intermediate SDK assembly artifact rather than an independent release asset, and only the macOS archives contain it.
Publication validates the complete archive and checksum set before making a release public, so a failed build or incomplete asset set cannot publish a partial release.
CMake install rules are the single file-layout source of truth.
Installers do not edit application projects, run `huxerui setup`, download platform toolchains, or silently select an Android SDK, NDK, Xcode installation, compiler, or signing identity.

### Built-in resources

The precompiled HuxerUI built-in resource package is a first-class SDK artifact at the same version as the CLI, CMake package, and platform artifacts.
It is not hidden inside an AAR, XCFramework, Swift package, or platform library as another runtime resource store.

An application produces exactly one final resource package with this order:

```text
HuxerUI built-in package
  -> library packages in huxerui_use_library order
  -> application resource roots in declaration order
  -> final resources.bin
```

Later matching variants replace earlier variants, so an application may deliberately override the `huxerui` namespace.
`hrc` validates its binary format while merging and rejects incompatible packages rather than requiring separate bundle metadata.
The final package is staged into Android assets, an Apple application bundle, the Windows or Linux application resource directory, or the Web preload set by the owning platform build.
Android resources and manifests, Apple asset catalogs and property lists, Windows resources, Linux desktop metadata, and Web shell assets remain platform resources and do not enter `resources.bin` unless the application explicitly declares them as HuxerUI resources.

The SDK, platform artifacts, and built-in resource versions must agree.
Compatibility is expressed through standard CMake and platform-package versions plus the resource binary format, not through an additional HuxerUI manifest.

## Platform drivers

The CLI core dispatches through one internal `PlatformDriver` interface.
A driver owns:

- Its stable platform identifier.
- Current-host capability.
- Required tools, host environment diagnosis, and shell diagnostics.
- Setup planning and execution for the platform prerequisites it owns.
- Source-controlled shell templates.
- Build and run command construction.
- Platform artifact discovery for packaging.
- Optional device discovery.

The interface deliberately contains only capabilities implemented by the current command surface.
Setup capabilities are added with the `setup` command rather than through a parallel environment-provider hierarchy.
Shared CLI code coordinates confirmation, process execution, and final diagnosis, while each existing driver owns platform-specific requirements and official installation commands.
Clean and signing operations should likewise be added when those commands exist rather than anticipated as empty virtual methods.

The current registry contains Windows, macOS, Linux, Web, Android, and iOS.
The registry and shared command helpers remain in the CLI platform core, while each driver implementation owns one platform-specific source file.
The registry is compiled into the CLI; it is not a dynamic extension mechanism, and adding a platform does not change project discovery or command parsing.

Editable project, library, Preview, platform-shell, and generated-integration templates live as ordinary files under `tools/huxerui_cli/templates`.
CMakeRC compiles that tree into the CLI, and the internal template loader renders both relative output paths and file contents from the same project identity and feature-specific replacements.
The installed CLI therefore remains a single executable and never searches the current directory, source checkout, or SDK for template files at runtime.
These CLI templates are build-time tool resources and are independent of the application-facing `resources.bin` package.
Empty scaffold files and directories remain explicit generator structure because an embedded filesystem cannot represent an empty directory.
The application-development Skill is not a project template: the SDK installs its canonical directory under `share/huxerui/skills`, and `create` copies that directory transactionally into each selected Agent location.
The CLI never symlinks the SDK Skill into an application project, so the generated project remains portable and can customize its own copy.

### Windows

The shell supplies an application manifest and optional platform CMake inputs.
The root CMake project creates the executable and links the installed or source HuxerUI target.
The driver runs only on Windows.

### macOS

The shell supplies bundle metadata through `Info.plist.in` and optional platform CMake inputs.
The root CMake project creates the application bundle.
The driver runs only on macOS.

### Linux

The Linux backend is supported and the root CMake project owns its executable, common application target, generated resources, and HuxerUI linkage.
The source-controlled `platform/linux` directory marks Linux as enabled without adding a second CMake project or placeholder platform configuration.
The CLI driver runs on Linux hosts, configures and builds the root project, discovers the executable through generated application integration metadata, and launches it with its containing directory as the working directory.
Linux-specific library C++ sources under `platform/linux/src` join the ordinary library target and therefore require no platform-package projection.
Missing PlatformView, accessibility, or library capabilities are backend limitations to implement explicitly; they do not make Linux a future platform.

### Web

The shell supplies the browser-owned HTML document and empty host element used by the adapter-owned composition root.
The driver wraps the existing Emscripten CMake backend with `emcmake`, retains incremental output under `.huxerui/build/<home-key>/web`, and uses `emrun` for local development on desktop hosts.
It does not define a parallel JavaScript component system or expose browsers as synthetic devices.
Termux instead uses Python's standard-library HTTP server because `emrun` does not recognize Android hosts, then opens the bound loopback URL through `termux-open`.
Formal distribution uses an Emscripten-compatible SDK archive, and a source checkout remains an explicit override of the same root-project configuration.

### Android

The shell is a Gradle application with an `app` module.
Gradle owns Android packaging, manifest merging, SDK selection, ABI variants, and APK output.
CMake owns the common application target, code generation, common libraries, and final HuxerUI resource generation.

Published builds consume the Java-only HuxerUI AAR through Gradle and the ABI-specific shared library through the canonical CMake target.
Source development substitutes the repository Android library explicitly while preserving the same Gradle and CMake target contract.
The app module's `externalNativeBuild` points directly at the repository root `CMakeLists.txt`.
There is no project-level `huxerui.cmake`, generated Android SDK configuration projection, or CMake-owned copy of Gradle configuration in the target architecture.
Desktop hosts use `sdkmanager` and ADB for managed Android SDK components and external devices.
Termux instead requires a compatible SDK and NDK supplied outside HuxerUI, overrides AGP's `aapt2` executable with the Termux package, restricts the build to the local `arm64-v8a` ABI, and opens the APK with the system package installer.

### iOS

The shell is a source-controlled Xcode application project. It owns the Info.plist, launch screen, asset catalog, build configurations, shared scheme, product identifier, signing, Capabilities, platform sources, archive behavior, and final App Bundle.

On iOS, the application-core archive contains the static `Application` declaration, while the shell's minimal Objective-C++ `main.mm` calls `RunApplication()`. `huxerui_add_app()` produces an application-core archive instead of another executable or App Bundle. CMake places the archive, linker response file, and merged HuxerUI resource package under `huxerui-ios/<target>` so every Xcode shell consumes the same stable application-core contract. CMake remains responsible for the common C++ sources, composable code generation, resource generation, and linking the selected installed or source HuxerUI static target. Xcode remains responsible for process entry, platform resources, destination selection, signing, packaging, installation metadata, and debugging, and fails its staging phase when the merged HuxerUI resource package is absent.

iOS has one application build path. Source-checkout development and a packaged SDK use the same application-core contract; the selected `HUXERUI_HOME` determines whether the framework is imported or compiled. The driver discovers paired devices and booted Simulators, invokes `xcodebuild`, installs through `devicectl` or `simctl`, and opens the checked-in project directly. Distribution export automation and public UIView embedding are not part of the current SDK workflow.

`huxerui open ios` refreshes library integration and opens the Xcode project without modifying local framework or signing settings. Repository examples use one source-controlled platform runner whose `HUXERUI_APP_TARGET` build setting selects an `example_*` application core; adding an example does not add another Xcode project or platform application target.

## Libraries and platform integration

The CMake target, acquisition, and resource contracts in this section are implemented.
Android and iOS platform-package scaffolding is implemented.
Android platform-package discovery and application attachment are implemented.
iOS builds project the same library graph into one generated local Swift package aggregator and attach its stable product to the source-controlled Xcode application.

A HuxerUI library is a compile-time CMake target that may also contain platform packages implementing typed services, PlatformView factories, or ExternalTexture producers.
It is not a runtime plugin and does not require a universal public `Library` base class.

### Library scaffolding and preview

Project scaffolding distinguishes the application and library shapes explicitly:

```text
huxerui create app <name> [--id <reverse-domain-id>] [-p|--platform <platform-list>] [--agent <agent-list>]
huxerui create library <name> [--namespace <cpp-namespace>] [--target <public-cmake-target>] [--id <reverse-domain-id>] [-p|--platform <platform-list>] [--agent <agent-list>]
```

Library names do not require a `huxerui-` prefix and may use uppercase ASCII letters.
The scaffold preserves the supplied name for the repository directory and project display name and derives a lowercase snake-case project-local identifier for private source filenames and Preview targets.
For example, `CameraKit`, `camera-kit`, and `camera_kit` derive `camera_kit`; leading, trailing, or repeated separators are rejected.

`--namespace` owns the exact C++ namespace used by generated declarations and definitions.
It accepts one or more non-reserved ASCII C++ identifiers separated by `::` and otherwise preserves the supplied spelling.
`--target` owns the exact consumer-facing CMake target used by `huxerui_use_library`.
It accepts either one ASCII letter-and-digit segment or exactly two such segments separated by `::`, including targets such as `HuxerUI::Camera`.
The CLI does not reserve package prefixes; generated targets must still avoid actual CMake target collisions.
The default namespace is the project-local snake-case identifier.
The default public target removes project-name separators and capitalizes lowercase segment starts while preserving intentional capitalization, so `CameraKit` generates `CameraKit::CameraKit` and `HuxerUI-CameraKit` generates `HuxerUICameraKit::HuxerUICameraKit`.

The public target deterministically projects the common build identities without adding more CLI options or editable metadata.
Each target segment becomes a lowercase token without inserted separators.
An unqualified target is used directly as the implementation and public target without an alias; its lowercase token remains the resource namespace and both header tokens, so `CameraKit` produces target `CameraKit`, resource namespace `camerakit`, and primary header `<camerakit/camerakit.h>`.
A qualified target such as `Scave::Camera` produces implementation target and resource namespace `scave_camera`, primary header `<scave/camera.h>`, and alias `Scave::Camera`.
If both qualified segments normalize to the same token, as in `CameraKit::CameraKit`, the implementation target and resource namespace fold to `camerakit` rather than repeating the token.
Only qualified public targets need an alias.

`--id` is the complete stable reverse-domain project identifier rather than an organization prefix.
For an application it initializes the Android application ID and namespace, Apple bundle identifier, and equivalent platform product identifiers.
For a library it initializes the Android library namespace and the CLI's stable platform-package identity.
Maven coordinates, the C++ namespace, the CMake target, and resource namespaces remain owned by their respective platform or common project files and are not inferred by splitting `--id`.
The generated iOS Swift product follows the public CMake target suffix because the existing library graph records only that target and source root; the Swift package name and other platform publication policy remain platform-owned.
When omitted, the scaffold uses `com.example.<normalized-name>` as an editable development default.

Project kind selects the platform artifact shape, so there are no separate Android application-versus-library or Apple application-versus-package options.
An Android application receives a Gradle application shell, while an Android library receives an independent Gradle library build.
An iOS application receives an Xcode application project, while an iOS library receives a Swift package with a library product.
Platform-specific SDK levels, dependencies, permissions, capabilities, publishing coordinates, and product policy are edited in those generated platform projects instead of being additional cross-platform CLI arguments.

Application creation retains the current all-platform default when `--platform` is omitted.
Library creation without `--platform` creates no Library platform package, while its ordinary Preview application receives every platform shell.
This keeps the Library platform-neutral and makes `huxerui run <platform>` immediately available from its root on a compatible host.
Each platform selected for a library creates the matching application shell below `examples/preview`.
Windows, Linux, and macOS create CMake source roots under `platform/<platform>/src`, Android additionally creates an independent Gradle library under `platform/android`, and iOS creates a Swift Package under `platform/ios`.
The macOS source root may contain C++ and Objective-C++ sources compiled into the common library target; iOS native sources remain owned exclusively by its Swift Package and Xcode integration.
Web currently adds only the Preview shell because no separate platform-package shape has been defined for it.
`platform add` applies the same behavior after creation, fills whichever Library package or Preview shell is missing, and leaves an existing counterpart untouched.
Later commands obtain launch artifacts from the owning platform or CMake build output, while platform-package attachment uses the platform-neutral generated library graph.
Deleting `.huxerui` and regenerating it does not require parsing `CMakeLists.txt` or maintaining a second editable manifest.
The generated library's CMake planning output records the exact namespace and public target alongside its project identity.
`platform add` reads that planning output and recomputes the header, implementation target, and resource namespace through the same deterministic projection used during creation.

A library never gains an application entry solely for previewing.
Every generated library instead contains `examples/preview`, an ordinary standalone HuxerUI application that consumes the library through a local path:

```cmake
huxerui_add_app(example_camera_kit
        SOURCES
            src/app.cpp
        RESOURCES
            resources
        RESOURCE_NAMESPACE
            app
)

huxerui_use_library(example_camera_kit
        TARGET CameraKit::CameraKit
        PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/../.."
)
```

The preview installs the same public RootHook that a consuming application uses:

```cpp
#include <huxerui/huxerui.h>
#include <camerakit/camerakit.h>

using namespace huxerui;

View App() {
  return MaterialTheme {
    camera_kit::CameraPreview(),
  };
}

const Application application{
    App,
    {
        .root_hooks = {
            camera_kit::Install,
        },
    }
};
```

Developers use the ordinary application commands from either the library root or the preview directory. Commands issued at the library root resolve to `examples/preview` without introducing a separate library build path:

```bash
huxerui run android
huxerui run ios
huxerui open ios
```

There is no separate library preview Runtime or `library run` build path.
The preview is a real HuxerUI application consuming the common library through CMake.
Its Android Gradle application consumes the library's Gradle library, and its iOS Xcode application consumes the library's Swift package through the generated aggregator.
These paths validate platform dependency resolution, mergeable platform declarations where supported, explicit RootHook installation, PlatformView behavior, and nonvisual service lifecycle through the same path used by an external application.
Common C++ tests, platform-package tests, and the preview application remain complementary rather than replacing one another.

The library repository declares its common C++ target and resources in CMake rather than adding a HuxerUI-specific JSON or YAML manifest:

```cmake
huxerui_add_library(camerakit
        SOURCES
            src/camera_kit.cpp
        RESOURCES
            resources
        RESOURCE_NAMESPACE
            camerakit
)

add_library(CameraKit::CameraKit ALIAS camerakit)
```

Applications acquire and link one library through one repeated helper.
A local path supports application and library development in one checkout:

```cmake
huxerui_use_library(my_app
        TARGET CameraKit::CameraKit
        PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libraries/CameraKit"
)
```

A GitHub or other HTTPS Git repository can use a pinned commit:

```cmake
huxerui_use_library(my_app
        TARGET CameraKit::CameraKit
        URL "https://github.com/example/CameraKit.git"
        COMMIT "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
)
```

It can instead use a release tag when human-readable version selection is preferred:

```cmake
huxerui_use_library(my_app
        TARGET CameraKit::CameraKit
        URL "https://github.com/example/CameraKit.git"
        TAG "v1.2.0"
)
```

A library target declared by the application or another CMake package is consumed without a source location:

```cmake
find_package(CameraKit CONFIG REQUIRED)

huxerui_use_library(my_app
        TARGET CameraKit::CameraKit
)
```

PATH and URL are mutually exclusive.
PATH resolves relative to the caller and uses the local source directly.
URL accepts HTTPS Git repositories only and requires exactly one of COMMIT or TAG.
COMMIT and TAG are mutually exclusive.
COMMIT requires a full 40-character SHA.
TAG accepts an unqualified valid Git tag name and resolves it through the repository's exact `refs/tags/` namespace, so a branch with the same name is never selected.
Remote source uses FetchContent's normal build-directory cache, and repeated use by several application targets acquires and configures the repository only once.
FetchContent owns Git discovery and tag validation when it needs to clone or update a repository; supplying source through its standard override does not add a separate Git requirement.
If the requested target already exists, PATH and URL must be omitted; the helper never assigns a requested origin to an unrelated target.
The helper verifies that acquisition creates the requested CMake target, links it to the application, and appends its compiled resource package in declaration order without a separate finalize call.
Calling `target_link_libraries` alone links ordinary code but intentionally does not merge library resources or request platform-package discovery.

The application CMakeLists is both the dependency declaration and version selection.
A full commit SHA is the recommended reproducible remote form.
A tag is easier to read but can be moved by the repository owner, so it does not provide the same immutable dependency identity.
There is no second dependency list or lock manifest in the current design.
Remote CMake source executes with the same authority as any other build dependency, so HTTPS transport does not replace commit review and pinning.

Library resource directories are ordinary ordered target resource roots.
Their CMake `NAMESPACE` selects the domain, and applications may add a later root with the same namespace to replace selected variants.
The final package is one merged binary index and payload set rather than a runtime collection of library bundles.
PATH and URL libraries compile these packages from source; the binary installation contract for resource-bearing predeclared libraries remains future packaging work.

The implemented common library integration pipeline is:

```text
huxerui_use_library declaration order
  -> acquire or reuse library target
  -> link common C++ target and append its resource package
```

Android platform integration continues from the resolved library source roots:

```text
library target closure
  -> retain each resolved library source root
  -> discover the current platform package by convention
  -> attach that package to the platform shell
  -> platform build system
```

CMake does not parse platform directories or model platform dependencies, permissions, products, manifests, or package-manager options.
Its generated library graph exposes only the library target identity, declaration order, and resolved source root already established while acquiring the common target.
The Android CLI driver uses that topology to locate `platform/android`, attaches each discovered Gradle library to the application shell, and delegates its contents to Gradle.
The application platform CMake build includes the same root CMake project, so common library targets and Android C++ sources participate in one graph rather than a second library graph.
The iOS CLI driver projects the same graph into one generated local Swift package aggregator below `.huxerui/generated/ios/libraries` before building or opening Xcode.
The source-controlled Xcode application references one stable aggregator product, so adding or removing libraries does not rewrite the project file.
The aggregator only composes library packages; application privacy text, entitlements, capabilities, signing, and final product policy stay in the Xcode shell.
Windows, Linux, and Web library sources join the common target directly from their platform source roots, so those platforms do not need platform-package projection.
Web libraries select C++ and Emscripten glue from their own CMake target and declare any JavaScript link inputs there; the CLI does not translate JavaScript package metadata into the common library graph.

Runtime installation remains explicit C++ application policy.
An application includes the library's public header and places its typed installer directly in `AppOptions::root_hooks`:

```cpp
#include <camerakit/camerakit.h>

const Application application{
    App,
    {
        .root_hooks = {
            camera_kit::Install,
        },
    }
};
```

There is no generated installer header, hidden application-entry rewriting, or generic runtime library registry. The process-level `Application` registers only its root and `AppOptions`; library installation remains explicit through `root_hooks`.
Generated platform attachment files remain build output rather than another editable project or runtime plugin list.

Platform dependencies remain expressed in their owning ecosystem.
An Android library's `platform/android` directory is an Android library whose Gradle build declares Java or Kotlin sources, Android resources, C++ dependencies, and third-party libraries, while its library manifest declares mergeable Android components and permissions.
An Apple library's `platform/ios` directory is a Swift package whose `Package.swift` declares targets, resources, linked system libraries, and package dependencies.
Its generated library product matches the suffix of a qualified public CMake target, such as `Camera` for `Scave::Camera`, so the generated aggregator can attach it without parsing `Package.swift` or duplicating product metadata in the library graph.
For an unqualified target, the existing platform product-name normalization remains local to the iOS package generator.
Equivalent future platforms use their own package and build systems.

The application shell owns final application policy even when a platform package contributes mergeable declarations.
Android applications may override or remove declarations merged from a library manifest.
Apple usage descriptions, entitlements, capabilities, signing, and other application-target policy remain in the source-controlled Xcode shell; a Swift package never invents application-facing privacy text.
The CLI does not translate these declarations into CMake or synthesize policy on the application's behalf.

Libraries use three runtime integration forms:

- Permission, Audio, Camera control, and similar nonvisual features register PlatformModule factories whose instances are owned by component Lifecycle or typed Root Services.
- WebView, map, document preview, and platform SDK controls register PlatformView factories by stable string type.
- Camera preview, video decode, and high-frequency visual streams create shared platform-specific ExternalTexture objects and return their platform-neutral base pointers to shared code.

One library may combine the forms.
Camera may provide a shared service or a component-owned session plus ExternalTexture preview, while Audio may expose either lifetime and WebView provides a PlatformView factory.
The application consumes concrete library components, services, or typed `UseXxx()` helpers; there is no generic library-service lookup.

PlatformView and nonvisual PlatformModule implementations share the internal surface-owned `PlatformRegistry` defined in [Architecture Design](architecture.md#platformregistry-contract).
Concrete C++ properties, creation options, calls, results, and events remain strongly typed through direct C++ factories and ordinary library-defined objects or interfaces.
`PlatformPayload` is the value model used by HuxerUI's common bridge for C++ crossings into Java, Kotlin, Objective-C, Swift, JavaScript, or another platform language and is never the Windows or Linux C++ factory protocol.
Each structured value carried by the common payload bridge owns the static `Encode(const T&)` or `Decode(const PlatformPayload&)` operation required by its direction of travel.
There is no separate codec type, per-platform codec, or factory-provided codec, and direct C++ registrations do not invoke these operations.
Registry entries contain no Methods or Events list and do not inspect business method signatures.
Libraries choose virtual functions, concrete values, callbacks, pimpl, or their own type erasure and independently choose synchronous, asynchronous, callback, stream, cancellation, and error conventions.
Stable method strings exist only inside the common call channel or a custom bridge, while Event Keys directly inherit `Event<Result(Arguments...)>` and add only their stable boundary name without redeclaring `Signature`; the concrete request, result, event argument, or event result type owns any required boundary conversion.
`void` is the uniform no-value contract and maps to a strictly validated Null payload only when crossing a language boundary.
The common cross-language bridge serializes `PlatformPayload` through one HuxerUI binary envelope.
The Android SDK, Web adapter, and separate iOS/macOS Objective-C bridges convert that representation to their structurally immutable platform-language `PlatformPayload` APIs through the same value and envelope contract.
The Android value type provides explicit construction, exact scalar reads, field and element navigation, unknown-field validation, and path-aware diagnostics without adding a public Reader, Builder, Writer, or Codec.
Library-defined Java, Swift, Objective-C, and JavaScript boundary types own their local encode and decode operations; the SDK does not provide reflection-based object mapping, JSON conversion, numeric coercion, or public HUXP byte access.
Library implementations never parse transport bytes, while opaque ExternalTexture, FileReference, and BufferReference values use envelope-local bridge capability tables rather than a public numeric handle.
Callbacks, arbitrary C++ objects, and system handles never enter the payload; an ExternalTexture capability retains the same shared platform-owned object used by rendering.
BufferReference retains an address-stable CPU memory range without copying or serializing its bytes; producer synchronization and frame metadata remain library responsibilities.
Android and Apple bridge this capability; Web rejects it explicitly. Windows and Linux libraries use the C++ type directly.

A library's RootHook explicitly registers each visual or nonvisual factory under a nonempty case-sensitive UTF-8 name such as `WebView`, `web/WebView`, or `audio/Player`.
Names have no required separator, hierarchy, prefix, or grammar beyond valid UTF-8; `/` is only an optional library naming convention.
The two factory kinds share one type namespace, so duplicate or kind-conflicting registration fails during library installation.
Library registration does not use a generated header, hidden application-entry rewriting, editable metadata bundle, or process-global static initializer.
The library's documented Install function remains an ordinary RootHook selected explicitly by the application.
The library may implement that public Install function once, provide mutually exclusive platform definitions, or delegate to any common and platform helpers it chooses.
Registration accepts a compatible direct callable, retained object, framework bridge adapter, or library-owned adapter; HuxerUI does not require a public factory base class, a `CreateXxxFactory()` convention, or one construction pattern across platforms.

`RootContext::RegisterPlatformModule()`, `RegisterPlatformView()`, and typed `OpenPlatformModule<Module>()` are the only C++ RootHook registry operations; the internal registry has no public accessor.
A nonvisual factory returns the exact registered Module handle, which may be a value facade, move-only owner, shared interface pointer, or another library-defined RAII type.
An installer may wrap or provide that handle as a shared service through `root.Provide()`, but service ownership is optional.
A component-scoped library API instead uses the typed free `OpenPlatformModule<Module>(name, options)` operation defined by [PlatformModule ownership](architecture.md#platformmodule-ownership) from committed `Lifecycle` setup and releases its instance through the returned cleanup.
Runtime resolves that operation through the declaring scope's surface registry only for the duration of setup; it does not expose a process-global registry or remain callable from composition, event handlers, asynchronous callbacks, or cleanup.
Both ownership forms retain the library's own typed API and deterministic teardown without exposing wire payloads to application code.
Applications do not register factories, call the low-level open operations, or use string method names directly; concrete library services, components, and optional `UseXxx()` hooks hide those details.
There is no generic `UsePlatformModule`, public provider, application-visible generic instance, or mandatory PlatformModule service base class.

A concrete PlatformView library may expose a stable typed Controller for imperative commands.
The Controller is an attachable C++ facade rather than Properties or a transported platform object, and the library chooses its public synchronous, asynchronous, callback, and error semantics.
Every Controller-capable registration binds the exact public Controller type, while a PlatformView without a Controller creates no binding.
Controller values are safely retainable and equality preserves their logical command-target identity across recomposition.
`.Controller(controller)` creates the typed binding internally, and the factory adapter connects its mounted instance to the exact Controller type.
HuxerUI requires no Controller base class, embedded binding, State, pimpl, Access helper, Backend, or Connection.
Direct C++ implementations attach without a proxy.
Android Java, Web JavaScript, and Apple Objective-C/Swift implementations may compose the common call channel without changing the public Controller API.
Controller replacement reconnects the retained PlatformView without resending Properties, and unmount disconnects it before invalidating calls and disposing the platform instance.

RootHooks are the only PlatformModule and PlatformView registration entry point.
Android provides Java and Kotlin `PlatformViewFactory`, `PlatformView`, `PlatformModuleFactory`, and `PlatformModule` interfaces for the common JNI class adapter, while a platform source may register a custom JNI-backed factory instead.
Apple libraries register direct Objective-C++ factories or actual Objective-C/Swift factory objects through the iOS or macOS adapter, while Web libraries register direct Emscripten C++ factories or actual JavaScript factory objects.
All forms still enter the same Core registry from one RootHook.
The Android common language interfaces use `create`, View access, `update`, `invoke`, and `dispose`, with narrow `PlatformEventEmitter`, `PlatformResult`, and optional `PlatformCancellation` endpoints instead of generic Module or View Context objects.
The common bridge owns request identity, late-result rejection, thread transfer, invalidation, and binary payload conversion.
Each cross-language instance and every direct PlatformView factory receives one framework-owned emitter.
The Apple adapters preserve the same result, cancellation, late-delivery, and disposal rules independently in their UIKit and AppKit implementations.
Libraries do not define one native callback for each event, and per-invocation Result completion remains distinct from instance-level event emission.
Factories are surface-owned registrations that may create multiple independently owned instances; successful instances dispose exactly once, failed creation publishes no event, and platform host values are explicit per-platform factory parameters rather than a universal Context abstraction.
The platform package makes those implementations linkable but does not register them through an application host, application delegate, `mountHuxerUIApp()`, generated registrant, or global initializer.

The Runtime-side PlatformView lifecycle, exact RenderComposition ordering, typed events, nonvisual instance protocol, and ExternalTexture ownership are defined in [Architecture Design](architecture.md#platform-content-integration) rather than duplicated here.
Platform-package attachment only makes a library's platform implementation available to the platform application target; the library's explicit RootHook still installs its factories and services without another runtime API or composition mode.
A PlatformView factory must preserve the shared ordering, clipping, input, focus, and accessibility contract; a platform implementation that cannot do so fails explicitly instead of moving the platform object to a global foreground or background plane.
Library-owned typed services and component-lifetime wrappers keep boundary conversion and stable method names behind their concrete APIs.
Windows posts a coalesced private message to its application HWND, the macOS and iOS adapters supply a `UIThreadDispatcher` backed by the platform main queue, Linux attaches idle sources to the owning GLib main context, Web queues work through the browser event loop, and Android dispatches through its owning `HuxerUIView`. `example_platform_module` provides source-level Windows thread-pool timer, Foundation, Linux `timerfd`, Emscripten interval, and Java integrations behind one typed service. On Windows, Apple platforms, Linux, Web, and Android it additionally returns an `ExternalTexture` from a typed service and publishes copied RGBA, `CVPixelBuffer`, cloned WebCodecs `VideoFrame`, or `Bitmap` frames without per-frame PlatformModule callbacks.

Camera or video may still use PlatformView when a platform interactive hierarchy is required and the platform implementation satisfies that contract.
Pure high-frequency visual output normally uses ExternalTexture because it remains an ordinary renderer command and supports unrestricted HuxerUI transforms, clipping, opacity, and paint interleaving without a platform input subtree.

ExternalTexture requires neither a factory registry nor a texture registry.
A library's platform implementation creates a shared concrete texture such as `ios::PixelBufferTexture` or `android::BitmapTexture` and returns it as `std::shared_ptr<ExternalTexture>` through its typed service and the framework-owned boundary conversion when crossing into another platform language.
Committed RenderScene visibility subscribes each consuming Runtime independently, while the matching renderer keeps only a private cache for concrete textures it can import.
Image accepts ExternalTexture and records DrawExternalTextureCommand, so Camera overlays, transforms, clipping, and damage remain ordinary RenderScene behavior.
Frame publication replaces a latest-wins platform mailbox and requests presentation without writing application State, exposing a numeric texture identity, or executing a per-frame language bridge callback.
The complete payload, lifetime, visibility, scheduling, and platform contract is defined in [Architecture Design](architecture.md#externaltexture).

Libraries provide these factories, registrations, boundary value operations, and typed services without introducing Runtime subclasses or platform types into shared public headers.
Platform integration reports a missing current-platform package, ambiguous platform product, duplicate registration name, factory-kind conflict, malformed subscribed payload, unsupported exact-composition capability, or incompatible HuxerUI version with the owning library and application target in the diagnostic.
The implemented CMake integration already rejects invalid URL schemes, absent revisions, ambiguous origins, duplicate library use, and missing requested targets.

## Future work

- Automate signed platform package publication where a platform ecosystem requires it.
- Add iOS application distribution export and public UIView embedding workflows without changing the application-core contract.
- Add an OHOS shell and SDK artifact through the same CMake, CLI, and packaging ownership boundaries.

## Errors, security, and reproducibility

- Unknown platform identifiers are usage errors.
- Unknown or incomplete project shells identify the exact path and expected file.
- Unsupported host-target combinations fail before starting any build.
- Platform process failures retain their command and exit code without hiding platform logs.
- Process invocation passes argument arrays and does not route ordinary commands through a shell.
- Windows batch tools are handled explicitly and reject unsafe expansion characters.
- `setup` displays every intended external change before execution unless the user explicitly supplies `--yes`.
- `setup` uses official package sources or platform tools, preserves their diagnostics, and never reports success before the shared read-only checks pass.
- Manual installers, license acceptance, account login, signing, and other interactive platform requirements remain visible incomplete actions rather than inferred success.
- Generated metadata contains no credentials or signing keys.
- Git libraries must use full commit SHA revisions for reproducible builds.
- A clean checkout plus the selected SDK and platform toolchains reproduces generated integration metadata.

## Validation

The current workflow is covered by:

- CLI project, shell, diagnostics, device parsing, process execution, and command-construction tests.
- CLI Android shell tests for root-CMake configuration, Gradle-owned platform values, source or installed SDK selection, library attachment, application launch identity, and artifact collection.
- CMake library validation for URL policy, full commit revisions, unambiguous origins, predeclared targets, ordered library graph roots and resources, and explicit runtime Root Service installation.
- Installed Windows, macOS, and Linux consumer tests that install the SDK, run the installed CLI, create a project, and build it without source-tree lookup.
- SDK archive tests that verify checksums, the canonical extracted layout, the application-development Skill, embedded Android and Web artifacts, macOS-only iOS slices, host-tool isolation, and executable-relative CLI discovery.
- macOS and Linux installer tests that cover custom paths, profile preservation, repeat installation, failed-upgrade rollback, invalid checksums, unrelated directories, and uninstall.
- SDK release tests that reject invalid version tags, incomplete or unexpected asset sets, and mismatched archive checksums before publication.
- Existing common, header, code-generation, platform, and example builds.

Platform work must additionally validate every affected platform toolchain available on the development host and report unavailable platforms explicitly.
Android validation must verify that Gradle configures the root CMake project directly and that no SDK, NDK, ABI, identifier, or dependency policy is copied through generated CMake metadata.
Formal SDK validation must install a relocatable SDK, resolve it through both executable location and `HUXERUI_HOME`, build a clean generated consumer, merge the matching built-in resource package, exercise the source override through the same public targets, and inspect each available installer without mutating unrelated environment state.
Installer tests must use isolated installation prefixes and environment/profile fixtures, and verify that uninstall removes only installer-owned files and entries.
Setup tests must use controlled tool discovery and process execution fixtures, verify plan and confirmation behavior, and prove that post-install success is derived from the same diagnostics as `doctor` rather than from command exit status alone.
